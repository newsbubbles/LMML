# LMML
The LMML Engine acts as an interpreter between a standardized document format for autonomous agent configuration and the final text prompt fed to the API endpoint of a Large Language Model. LMML (Language Model Markup Language) is a proposed and open standard for giving agential configuration to a predictive API call on any large language model.
